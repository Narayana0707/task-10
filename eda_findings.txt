Outlier Count (IQR Method):
{'id': 0, 'Date': 0, 'number of bedrooms': 361, 'number of bathrooms': 379, 'living area': 395, 'lot area': 1652, 'number of floors': 0, 'waterfront present': 112, 'number of views': 1421, 'condition of the house': 18, 'grade of the house': 1319, 'Area of the house(excluding basement)': 402, 'Area of the basement': 287, 'Built Year': 0, 'Renovation Year': 666, 'Postal Code': 0, 'Lattitude': 3, 'Longitude': 184, 'living_area_renov': 338, 'lot_area_renov': 1517, 'Number of schools nearby': 0, 'Distance from the airport': 0, 'Price': 760}

Key Observations:
- Outliers were detected using IQR and capped to preserve data.
- Price-related variables show right skewness.
- Strong correlations observed among size, number of rooms, and price.

Why EDA is Important?
EDA helps understand data structure, detect anomalies, and prepare data for modeling.

Why not remove all outliers?
Outliers may represent genuine extreme cases and removing them can lead to information loss.
